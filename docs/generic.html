								<p>Cerner’s RevWorks custom reporting solutions became part of the standard Revenue Cycle offering for all Cerner clients due to increasing general availability demand. This scalable transition involved aligning 66 industry standard KPIs to Cerner’s standard KPIs across multiple reporting platforms and products to ensure continuity. Data across multiple products was incorporated in the suite of reports that solved some longstanding customer pain points.</p>
								<p>Cerner’s Model Experience Revenue Cycle Best Practice Guides integrated analytics and reporting into recommended workflows. Over 50 best practice guides were released over the course of seven Model Edition releases. These best practice guides optimized common Revenue Cycle processes such as charge reconciliation, denials management, and end of month close to name a few. This allowed staff to be more efficient, productive, and increased data validation. Incorporating analytics and reporting into these daily, weekly, and monthly tasks ensured timely revenue and earlier error detection.</p>
								<p>The transformation of Kipu Analytics provided a level playing field amongst the customer base. By alining to healthcare industry standards and value-based care metrics 22 KPIs were introduced into the new analytics package. The new standard suite of business intelligence dashboards maintained an average weekly active user stickiness of 95%. Analytics user adoption increased by 157% within the first four months post launch.</p>
								<p>With the development and rollout of Kipu’s new standard analytics package, revenue generating ideas starting with product packaging became executable. The creation of a new pricing model and the packaging of Kipu data products resulted in additional revenue stream opportunities. The commercialization of data products included seven data extract packages and various custom analytics options. The addition of these products resulted in the generation of $30,000 in new recurring monthly revenue.</p>
